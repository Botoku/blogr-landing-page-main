## Overview

Here is a project gotten off front end mentor which involves designing a page from scrathc and following a specified design. This site was built with HTML, CSS and a litlle touch of vanilla Javascript.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to position background images and manioulation of these background images based on the media queries at the diffent screen sizes. That i believe was the biggest take away from this project apart from the other necessary tjings that need to be done on every site. The navigation is like every other site and an be improved upon.

### Continued development

The drop down menu for the mobile header needs some javascript workinarouds for when one menu is open so we never have two drop down menus open on the mobile navigation
